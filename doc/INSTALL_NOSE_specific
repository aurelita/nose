NOSE specific installation instructions
=======================================

After downloading the NOSE package, unpack it using gzip and tar tools.
In the root of the source code tree, configure the package (see details
and options in the INSTALL file in the root of the package)

> ./configure

Then compile the package by typing

> make

and install it by

> make install

To finish the installation set enviromental variable NOSE_HOME to 
'$PACKAGE_PATH/nose-home', where $PACKAGE_PATH is the path into which
you installed the package (standard is /usr/local/bin). If your system
is parallelization capable, you might need to start the parallel
environmet, such as LAM by calling 'lamboot' command.

ONLY THEN YOU CAN PERFORM TESTS OF THE PACKEGE 
(it is not standard by this is how it is now)

To perform simple test, type

> make check
